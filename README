Older versions of vim:
	If you have vim 7.3 you can uncomment "set undofile" in the vimrc file, if you want.
Pre-reqs:
	vim
	ctags
Usage:
	In home directory:
	git clone --recursive https://github.com/bsagar3/.vim.git
	ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

You can also use the install_plugin.sh script to install new plugins:
	./install_plugin.sh <git-link> <output-folder>
	This script creates a submodule and makes a commit that a new plugin was installed
